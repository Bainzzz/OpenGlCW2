# OpenGlCW2
**Gameplay**

*My OpenGL project is a simple time based shooter where the player must aim at the targets, using the mouse, and then use left click to shoot at them and gain score. After shooting at the target it will dissapear to which another target will spawn in, ensuring 5 targets are on screen at all times. the player can also move aorund the stage using WASD, The goal of the game is for the player to try to obtain the highest score they can within a minute, the project serving as a bit of competitive fun as well as a simple little aim warmup game. After a minute has passed the player will be unable to shoot or move and must pres ESC to close the game, on the terminal the player's score will be displayed so they can return to try beat their score.*
